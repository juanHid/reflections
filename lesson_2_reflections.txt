What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Execute "git init" in the folder you what to track.
It creates a folder .git
You need to create this for use git later.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is temporal area where you can add states of files 
Working directory is showing the actual state
Repository have all the information of all states

You can add or remove files to this area without acting to the all repository,
once you are sure you make a commit and get it into the repo.
